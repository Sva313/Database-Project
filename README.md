# Project for Databases by **Cyber Insecurity**
This project is about creating a database for a fashion blogger with some special requirements.

We started off by gathering any existing data that will be included in the database.Then list the types of data to store and the entities that they describe like this:

+ user
+ roles
+ articles
+ category
+ comments
+ thematology
+ subcategory

This information will later become part of the data dictionary, which outlines the tables and fields within the database.

Once we knew what kinds of data the database will include, where that data comes from, and how it will be used, we were ready to start planning out the actual database.

From that point on we started specifying primary keys and analyzing the relationships between the entitys.

We then drew in a sketchbook the plan, basically an example drawing of the database and after that we made it look more professional by using the *ER Diagram Online Tool* app to finalize the project!
